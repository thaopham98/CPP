# Pastry Management Application
This is a console-based pastry store management application. 
I faced challenges in designing the app for efficient item storage and optimizing sorting and searching operations. I also focused on creating a user-friendly interface for customers to add and delete items easily. Overall, I utilized technical analysis to address these challenges and enhance the application's functionality. While my experience may be limited, I am confident in my ability to apply these skills in analyzing IT solutions for application systems.

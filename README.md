# C++ codes

Object oriented programming

I used Xcode for all these projects, so this is to help anyone who doesn't use XCode. After selecting the folder you want to see, click on that folder's name again to get to the c++ file. For example, you select the folder 'example', click 'example' -> 'example' -> 'main.cpp'. I hope this help :)
